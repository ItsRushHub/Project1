# Project1

Meal Finder is an application that enables people to input ingredients they have at home on to our website. Once the list is submitted, our app returns recipes that can be created using those ingredients! The purpose of the application is to provide people with relatively healthier food choices and reduce food waste.

This is the first project that I worked on. I mostly did alot of the CSS such as adding a click sound to the button and the top flare and I found the API key for the food recipes.
